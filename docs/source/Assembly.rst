Assembly

What is Assembly?
-----------------
Assembly is simply the process of building contigs (longer sequences)
from your raw read data. This is generally accomplished now with a 
de bruijn graph. I would like to make a distinction in terminology 
here as well. In using software and listening to other talk you may 
hear the term scaffold. Though some people may use contig and scaffold
interchangeably, they are NOT the same thing. A scaffold consists of contigs
and gaps, in other words it is an ordered series of contigs with a determined
order. This is just something to be aware of.
